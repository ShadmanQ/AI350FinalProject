# AI350FinalProject

## Group 3 - Smart Snake

### Shadman Quazi, Melissa Lynch, Zachary Wilson

Timeline:
- UI + Manual Snake w/Pygame - 4/26/2020
- BasicAI w/pure Random movement - 5/4/2020
- DQN Snake implementation with Pytorch - 5/14/2020


Usage

The folder deepQSnake has the final version of the code. The training algorithm is called in agent.py and the environment and game UI is handled in environment.py

**To run baseline snake**:
  python3 agent.py

This will start the training process, in which you can see the snake learning as it plays more games; this is seen via the pygame display as well as the results plot.
